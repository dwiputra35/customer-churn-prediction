# customer-churn-prediction
The company is facing challenges in minimizing customer churn risk for the products they offer. In order to maintain business sustainability and customer satisfaction, the company requires a solution that can predict potential churn among their customers using the product. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a churn prediction model that can identify customers with a high likelihood of churning, enabling the company to take proactive steps to retain them.

The main objective of this project is to develop an accurate churn prediction model based on historical customer data, to assist the company in identifying potentially churn-prone customers and taking proactive measures to retain them and improve overall customer retention.

This model achieved an 94% recall score for classifying the 'churn' class.
